# Speaker Diarization Pipeline Improvements

## Current Limitations & Solutions

### 1. **Overlapping Speech Detection**
Current systems struggle with simultaneous speech. Solutions:

#### A. Voice Activity Detection (VAD) Enhancement
```python
# Use pyannote's overlapped speech detection
from pyannote.audio import Model
overlap_detection = Model.from_pretrained("pyannote/overlapped-speech-detection")
```

#### B. Multi-channel Recording
- Use stereo/multi-channel recording when possible
- Process channels separately then merge
- Useful for interviews/podcasts with separate mics

### 2. **Interjection & Crosstalk Handling**

#### A. Shorter Window Analysis
```python
# Reduce minimum segment duration for better granularity
diarize_model = Pipeline.from_pretrained(
    "pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1",
    use_auth_token=token
)
diarize_model.instantiate({
    "segmentation": {
        "min_duration_on": 0.1,  # Shorter segments for interjections
        "min_duration_off": 0.1
    }
})
```

#### B. Force-Aligned Transcription
```python
# Use phoneme-level alignment for precise timing
from whisperx import load_align_model
model_a, metadata = load_align_model(
    language_code="en",
    device=device
)
result = whisperx.align(
    segments,
    model_a,
    metadata,
    audio,
    device,
    return_char_alignments=True  # Character-level precision
)
```

### 3. **Multi-Modal Approaches**

#### A. Combine Multiple Models
```python
def ensemble_diarization(audio_file):
    """Use multiple diarization models and vote"""
    
    # Model 1: PyAnnote
    pyannote_result = pyannote_diarize(audio_file)
    
    # Model 2: NeMo speaker diarization
    nemo_result = nemo_diarize(audio_file)
    
    # Model 3: Simple-diarizer
    simple_result = simple_diarize(audio_file)
    
    # Voting mechanism for consensus
    final_result = majority_vote([pyannote_result, nemo_result, simple_result])
    return final_result
```

#### B. Speaker Embedding Clustering
```python
from speechbrain.pretrained import EncoderClassifier

# Extract speaker embeddings
classifier = EncoderClassifier.from_hparams(
    source="speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb"
)

# Custom clustering for better speaker separation
from sklearn.cluster import SpectralClustering
clustering = SpectralClustering(
    n_clusters=num_speakers,
    affinity='nearest_neighbors',
    n_neighbors=5
)
```

### 4. **Post-Processing Improvements**

#### A. Rule-Based Corrections
```python
def fix_short_interjections(segments, min_duration=0.5):
    """
    Detect and properly attribute short interjections
    """
    corrected = []
    for i, seg in enumerate(segments):
        duration = seg['end'] - seg['start']
        
        # Short segments likely interjections
        if duration < min_duration:
            # Check surrounding context
            if i > 0 and i < len(segments) - 1:
                prev_speaker = segments[i-1].get('speaker')
                next_speaker = segments[i+1].get('speaker')
                
                # If surrounded by same speaker, likely an interjection
                if prev_speaker == next_speaker:
                    # Assign to opposite speaker
                    seg['speaker'] = get_other_speaker(prev_speaker)
        
        corrected.append(seg)
    return corrected
```

#### B. Linguistic Pattern Detection
```python
def detect_conversation_patterns(transcript):
    """
    Use linguistic cues to identify speaker changes
    """
    interjection_patterns = [
        r'\b(yeah|right|exactly|uh-huh|mm-hmm)\b',
        r'\b(wait|hold on|actually|but)\b',
    ]
    
    question_patterns = [
        r'.*\?$',
        r'^(what|where|when|why|how|who)\b',
    ]
    
    # Apply patterns to refine speaker boundaries
    # ...
```

### 5. **Advanced Techniques**

#### A. End-to-End Neural Diarization
```python
# Use EEND (End-to-End Neural Diarization)
from espnet2.bin.diar_inference import DiarizationInference

diarization = DiarizationInference(
    model_tag="espnet/jhu_diarization_eend",
    device=device
)
```

#### B. Real-time Diarization with Streaming
```python
# For live transcription with speaker tracking
from pyannote.audio.pipelines import OnlineSpeakerDiarization

pipeline = OnlineSpeakerDiarization()
for chunk in audio_stream:
    speakers = pipeline(chunk)
    # Process incrementally
```

### 6. **Data Augmentation for Training**

#### A. Create Synthetic Overlapped Speech
```python
def create_overlapped_training_data(audio1, audio2):
    """
    Generate training data with known overlaps
    """
    # Mix audio at various overlap ratios
    overlap_ratios = [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7]
    augmented_data = []
    
    for ratio in overlap_ratios:
        mixed = mix_audio_with_overlap(audio1, audio2, ratio)
        augmented_data.append(mixed)
    
    return augmented_data
```

### 7. **Interactive Correction Tools**

#### A. Web-based Correction Interface
```python
# Create interface for manual correction
import streamlit as st

def diarization_editor():
    st.title("Speaker Diarization Editor")
    
    # Load transcript
    segments = load_segments()
    
    for i, seg in enumerate(segments):
        col1, col2, col3 = st.columns([3, 1, 1])
        
        with col1:
            st.text(seg['text'])
        
        with col2:
            # Speaker dropdown
            seg['speaker'] = st.selectbox(
                f"Speaker {i}",
                ["Anastasia", "John", "Both"],
                index=["Anastasia", "John"].index(seg['speaker'])
            )
        
        with col3:
            # Mark as overlap
            seg['overlap'] = st.checkbox(f"Overlap {i}")
```

### 8. **Hybrid Approaches**

#### A. Combine ASR with Speaker Diarization
```python
def hybrid_transcription(audio_file):
    """
    Interleave ASR and diarization for better accuracy
    """
    # Step 1: Initial transcription
    transcript = whisper.transcribe(audio_file)
    
    # Step 2: Speaker diarization on segments
    for segment in transcript['segments']:
        segment_audio = extract_audio(
            audio_file, 
            segment['start'], 
            segment['end']
        )
        speakers = diarize_segment(segment_audio)
        segment['speakers'] = speakers
    
    # Step 3: Refine with overlap detection
    detect_overlaps(transcript)
    
    return transcript
```

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Impact, Low Effort:**
   - Reduce minimum segment duration
   - Add post-processing rules for interjections
   - Use character-level alignment

2. **High Impact, Medium Effort:**
   - Implement ensemble voting
   - Add overlap detection model
   - Create correction interface

3. **High Impact, High Effort:**
   - Train custom models on domain-specific data
   - Implement real-time streaming diarization
   - Build end-to-end neural system

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **For Your Current Use Case:**
   ```python
   # Adjust PyAnnote parameters for better interjection detection
   diarization_params = {
       "min_speakers": 2,
       "max_speakers": 2,
       "segmentation": {
           "min_duration_on": 0.1,  # Catch short interjections
           "min_duration_off": 0.05
       },
       "clustering": {
           "method": "centroid",
           "threshold": 0.5  # Lower for better separation
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Add Manual Correction Workflow:**
   - Export to format that preserves timing
   - Use audio editor with transcript sync
   - Re-import corrections

3. **Consider Alternative Tools:**
   - **Amazon Transcribe**: Has good speaker diarization
   - **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text**: Supports speaker diarization
   - **AssemblyAI**: Advanced diarization features
   - **Rev.ai**: Human-in-the-loop option

## Example: Enhanced Pipeline

```python
class EnhancedDiarizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.whisper_model = whisperx.load_model("large-v3")
        self.diarize_model = self.load_enhanced_diarization()
        self.overlap_detector = self.load_overlap_model()
    
    def process(self, audio_file):
        # 1. Initial transcription
        transcript = self.whisper_model.transcribe(audio_file)
        
        # 2. Enhanced diarization with overlap detection
        diarization = self.diarize_with_overlaps(audio_file)
        
        # 3. Merge with interjection detection
        result = self.merge_with_interjections(transcript, diarization)
        
        # 4. Post-process with rules
        result = self.apply_conversation_rules(result)
        
        # 5. Interactive correction if needed
        if self.needs_correction(result):
            result = self.interactive_correct(result)
        
        return result
```

# Building a Speaker Diarization Pipeline: A Technical Journey

## The Challenge

I had a 10-minute MP3 recording of an academic conversation between myself and Anastasia Salter discussing AI's role in education. The audio contained natural conversation dynamics - interruptions, overlapping speech, and quick interjections. My goal was clear: create an accurate transcript that properly identified who said what.

This wasn't just about transcription. I needed speaker diarization - the ability to answer "who spoke when" throughout the conversation. The recording featured my colleague Anastasia and me discussing OpenAI's partnership with Canvas, FERPA compliance concerns, and the balance between automation and human connection in education.

## Setting Up the Foundation

The first step involved establishing a robust technical stack. I used Claude's Deep Research, which suggested a stack of WhisperX for transcription, leveraging OpenAI's Whisper model for its accuracy, combined with PyAnnote.audio for speaker identification. These tools promised state-of-the-art performance, but integrating them properly would prove to be an interesting challenge.

Creating the environment was straightforward enough:
- Python 3.10 for compatibility
- PyTorch for deep learning support
- WhisperX for enhanced transcription with word-level timestamps
- PyAnnote.audio 3.1.1 for speaker diarization

However, I quickly discovered that modern audio processing has a hard dependency on FFmpeg. Without sudo access on my system, I had to get creative, downloading a portable FFmpeg binary to make the pipeline work.

## The First Transcription

My initial approach was optimistic - run WhisperX with the base model and see what happens. The transcription itself worked beautifully, producing 90 segments of text in about 2 minutes of processing time. The system correctly identified that it was English, captured the full 10.4 minutes of conversation, and even provided timestamps.

But there was a problem: no speaker identification. Every segment was labeled "UNKNOWN."

## The Authentication Dance

Speaker diarization with PyAnnote requires a HuggingFace token and acceptance of model terms. This isn't just bureaucracy - these models are powerful research tools with specific licensing requirements. I provided my token.

But even with authentication, I hit another wall. The system required acceptance of terms for two different models:
1. `pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1` - the main diarization pipeline
2. `pyannote/segmentation-3.0` - the segmentation model

After accepting both sets of terms on HuggingFace's website, the magic happened. The system successfully identified two speakers: SPEAKER_00 and SPEAKER_01.

## Making It Human

Raw speaker IDs aren't particularly useful, so I renamed them to reflect reality:
- SPEAKER_00 → Anastasia (me)
- SPEAKER_01 → John

This simple change transformed the transcript from a technical output to a readable conversation. But reviewing the results revealed significant issues.

## The Reality Check

Comparing the automated output with what actually occurred in the conversation exposed several critical problems:

### Missed Interjections
The system completely missed moments where John would interject briefly while I was speaking. For example, when I said "their little kids that they take with toys and crafts and all of the things," John added "And that they know the kids" - but this was lost in the automated transcript.

### Transcription Errors
Some amusing but problematic mistakes appeared:
- "agent-based tools" became "Asian face tools"
- "OpenAI's" became "open-ass"
- "co-pilot shit" became "co-pilot ship"
- "140-person classes" became "hundred and first 40 person classes"

### Lost Conversation Dynamics
The back-and-forth nature of academic discourse, with its confirmations, clarifications, and building on each other's ideas, was flattened into discrete speaker blocks.

## Building the Solution

Rather than accept these limitations, I developed a multi-layered correction system:

### Pattern-Based Analysis
I created an analyzer that could detect conversation patterns - short confirmations like "Right" or "Yeah" between longer segments often indicate interjections from the other speaker.

### Word-Level Corrections
I built a dictionary of common transcription errors specific to our academic context and technical discussions. The system now automatically corrects known issues.

### Interjection Detection
The pipeline now identifies parenthetical interjections and marks segments that are likely back-channel responses, helping preserve the conversational flow.

## The Technical Implementation

The final pipeline consists of several Python modules:

1. **diarize.py** - The main SpeakerDiarizer class handling the core pipeline
2. **analyze_corrections.py** - Pattern analysis and automatic correction application
3. **process_audio.py** - User-friendly wrapper for processing new audio files

The system now outputs multiple formats:
- Human-readable text transcripts with speaker labels
- JSON structured data for programmatic access
- SRT subtitles for video applications

## Lessons Learned

This project illuminated several important insights about speech processing:

### Current Limitations
- Speaker diarization models are trained primarily on formal speech (news, presentations) rather than natural academic conversations
- Overlapping speech and quick interjections remain challenging for current systems
- Domain-specific terminology requires custom correction dictionaries

### Practical Solutions
- Manual review remains essential for high-stakes transcription
- Multiple output formats serve different use cases
- Post-processing rules can catch many systematic errors
- Combining multiple models could improve accuracy

### The Human Element
Perhaps most importantly, this project reinforced that conversation is fundamentally human. The way John and I build on each other's ideas, finish each other's sentences, and use verbal confirmation to maintain engagement - these nuances matter. While AI can provide a strong foundation, capturing the full richness of human dialogue still requires human insight.

## Looking Forward

The pipeline is now functional and produces significantly better results than the raw automated output. Future improvements could include:

- Training custom models on academic discourse patterns
- Implementing real-time correction interfaces
- Using stereo recording to better separate speakers
- Adding confidence scores to flag uncertain segments

The irony isn't lost on me that while discussing concerns about AI in education, I was simultaneously building AI tools to help process that very conversation. But perhaps that's the point - these tools are most effective when we understand both their capabilities and limitations, using them to augment rather than replace human judgment.

## Technical Takeaway

For anyone building similar systems, remember:
1. Start with established tools (WhisperX, PyAnnote) but expect to customize
2. Authentication and licensing matter - respect model terms
3. Domain-specific post-processing is often necessary
4. Multiple output formats increase utility
5. Manual validation remains crucial for quality

The complete code and documentation are available in the repository, ready for others to adapt to their own conversational analysis needs. The journey from raw audio to meaningful transcript taught me as much about conversation itself as it did about the technology we use to process it.
